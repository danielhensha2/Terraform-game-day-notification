# Game-Notification-System

**Project Overview**

This project is an alert system that sends real-time NBA game day score notifications to subscribed users via SMS/Email. It leverages Amazon SNS, AWS Lambda and Python, Amazon EvenBridge and NBA APIs to provide sports fans with up-to-date game information. The project demonstrates cloud computing principles and efficient notification mechanisms. In this Project i used Terraform as infrastructure as code tool for automating the deployment of the AWS services.

**Features**

- Fetches live NBA game scores using an external API.
- Sends formatted score updates to subscribers via SMS/Email using Amazon SNS.
- Scheduled automation for regular updates using Amazon EventBridge.
- Designed with security in mind, following the principle of least privilege for IAM roles.

**Prerequisites**

- Free account with subscription and API Key at sportsdata.io
- Personal AWS account with basic understanding of AWS and Python
- Terraform and AWS CLI installed on your local machine
